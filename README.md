# PerRec

Github repository for user interfaces: 
Github for React application: 
Overview:
The application is simple and intuitive
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to develop PerRec web application. This application was developed with the goal to be used in the study of visualization techniques on recommender systems (particularly visualization recommender systems). 
User Interfaces:
Version I
The homepage of the PerRec is displayed below (Figure 1).

This following section explains the workflow of the prototypes. PerRec works as users enter the file upload page and upload their data file in the CSV format upon clicking ‘Browse’ button (Figure 2).  Users choose the file to upload and the webpage will then display the sample of the data (in the case that the data file is bigger than four columns). By displaying this page, users can check if they upload the right data file or not.

Then, users enter a page with questionnaire to ask about their profile and personality (Figure 3).

Then, they will get the visualization recommendation based on their personality and profile (shown in Figure 4).

Version II
This version is aiming at making an explainable recommendation page in the table format. Radar chart is used to help users see relationship between their personality traits and the generated recommended charts. Also, users have an option to see the rating of the chart.
